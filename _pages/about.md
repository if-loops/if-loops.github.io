I am a final-year PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge focusing on machine unlearning and a bit of agentic LLMs on the side.
Next to my studies, I am currently working part-time as a Student Researcher at Google DeepMind and have previoulsy interned at IBM Research in their AI Security & Privacy team working on automated LLM Red Teaming.
Prior to my PhD I worked at the Boston Consulting Group in Zurich and co-founded an ESA BIC-funded startup.
