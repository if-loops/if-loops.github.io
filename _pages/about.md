I am a final-year PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge. My research focuses on making machine learning models unlearn undesired data without having to retrain the whole model ($$$). This can used to remove [privacy infringing, copyrighted](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07707), [erroneous](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stefan-Schoepf/publication/386336087_Machine_unlearning_in_supply_chains/links/674dd742876bd1777836bcb9/Machine-unlearning-in-supply-chains.pdf), [poisoned](https://data.mlr.press/assets/pdf/v01-18.pdf), outdated or otherwise problematic data. I also work on some applications of agentic LLMs within [research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15398) and [hackathons](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/schoepfstefan_ai-engine-uk-university-hackathon-2025-activity-7297312723980161024-ukfz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABiL-0wBlMcKXxjEIZNd4waS-DXX4PRZJGQ).

Next to my studies, I am working part-time as a Student Researcher at Google DeepMind and have previoulsy interned at IBM Research in their AI Security & Privacy team working on [automated LLM Red Teaming](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/schoepfstefan_happy-to-share-that-i-won-the-best-presentation-activity-7221423807180247040-zvoH?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABiL-0wBlMcKXxjEIZNd4waS-DXX4PRZJGQ).
Prior to my PhD I worked at the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in Zurich and co-founded an ESA BIC-funded startup.
